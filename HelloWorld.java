/*
Java System.out.println() is used to print an argument that is passed to it.
The statement can be broken into 3 parts which can be understood separately as:

System: It is a final class defined in the java.lang package.
out: This is an instance of PrintStream type, which is a public and static member field of the System class.
println(): As all instances of PrintStream class have a public method println(), hence we can invoke the same on out as well. This is an upgraded version of print(). 
 It prints any argument passed to it and adds a new line to the output.
 We can assume that System.out represents the Standard Output Stream.
